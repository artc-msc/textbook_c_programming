Exercises from: The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
2nd edition

The intent is to not just learn C from the book but also practice using Git and
good coding practices such limiting nesting and using self-documenting code. For
example, the book often us simple letter variables which do not adequately
describe the purpose of the variable.

To this extent, the examples will not match the book examples one for one and
may be improved upon after initial completion.
